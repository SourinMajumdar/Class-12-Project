PROJECT OUTLINE:

This project has been created to present it as a simple illustrative of the humongous programs and coding which are used in reality in maintaining busy and huge airports which gives way to lakhs and thousands of passengers and hundreds of flights every day. Keeping everything right in such places is a difficult job and to handle the same every day, a very advanced level of management system is required to meet the requirements of that place. Starting from the security to time management, air traffic control to the booking system; all such aspects in their finest levels make such a station an ideal for place for people to start their journeys.
So, this project is a snippet of the flight booking and reservation system that is executed moment to moment in such places for the people to get their journeys started, and so it is named - 

“FLIGHT RESERVATION SYSTEM”
